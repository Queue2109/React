How to start a new app:
    npx create-react-app my-app
    cd my-app
    npm start


function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      Hello
    </div> //=> it actually translates as React.createElement('div', {className='App'}, 'Hello');
  );
}

react components:
- a function that returns jsx or
- a js class that has a render method

what makes a return of a function a react component is that it translates as React.createElement(blablabla). if you return just {}, there will be an error

WORKING WITH MULTIPLE COMPONENTS 
make a new folder and creat a js and css file for a component. 
import it to the main App.js and use it as <Component/>

React is not a self refresh/self update kind of thing, so you need to tell it when to update something
